# Session Summary

This session focused on overhauling the application's cron jobs, refactoring the reward system for better maintainability, and making the weekly user recap page dynamic.

### 1. Cron Job Enhancements
- **Modernized Authentication:** Updated all active cron jobs (`broadcast`, `reset-daily-tasks`, `reset-weekly-points`) to use the Vercel-recommended `x-vercel-cron-secret` header for authentication, enhancing security.
- **Refactored Broadcast Notifications:**
    - The broadcast logic was completely rewritten to be a notification-only system.
    - On reward days (Thursdays), it now sends personalized congratulatory notifications to the top 10 users on the leaderboard, detailing their rank and formatted reward amount.
    - On all other days, it sends a general reminder notification to all users with notification tokens.
    - Added a `withRetry` mechanism to the broadcast job to make it more resilient against database timeouts.
- **Updated Cron Schedules:** Modified `vercel.json` to schedule the cron jobs according to the new requirements:
    - `reset-daily-tasks`: 00:00 UTC daily
    - `broadcast`: 16:00 UTC daily
    - `reset-weekly-points`: 16:05 UTC every Thursday

### 2. Centralized Reward Tier Configuration
- **Created Config File:** Extracted hardcoded reward tier data into a new, single source of truth at `lib/rewardTiers.ts`. This file now manages reward amounts, display text, and the token name (`$CAP`).
- **Updated Frontend:** The main leaderboard page (`/dashboard/leaderboard`) now dynamically renders the reward tiers from this new configuration file.
- **Updated Backend:** The `reset-weekly-points` cron job now uses the same configuration file to calculate the `rewardEarned` value when creating the weekly snapshot, ensuring consistency.

### 3. Dynamic Weekly Recap Page
- **Created History API:** Built a new API endpoint (`/api/leaderboard/history`) that fetches a specific user's performance (rank, points, reward earned) from the previous week's database snapshot.
- **Updated Recap Page:** The weekly recap page (`/weekly-leaderboard`) was refactored to use this new API. It now displays accurate, dynamic data from the database instead of relying on hardcoded values.

### 4. Bug Fixes
- **Resolved Build Error:** Fixed a critical build error on the leaderboard page caused by a misplaced `import` statement during the reward tier refactoring.
